        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>A bit more about me, I'm a graduate from Thomas Jefferson University, where I mastered in Biopharmaceutical Process Engineering. I worked as a Process Engineer 
        for a few years before deciding this was not the path for me. While I enjoyed working in the lab, I've realized I'm more passionate about coding and decided to 
        code full-time. My passion for coding comes from my curiosity of learning new languages. I can speak three languages (Telugu, Hindi and English) and currently 
        learning Mandarin and Korean.</p>
        <p>I've begun my journey as a student once again at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> in order to achieve my goal of becoming a full time software developer. Apart from working and learning
        new languages, I enjoy reading books, going to musicals, and singing.</p>
        <p>I'm an eager learner and excited to join a team that is looking to hire a new developer (or a teammate for a hackathon). I'm looking forward to working with other
        developers in building great software.</p>
